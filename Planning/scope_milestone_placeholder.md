## Agile project
**Snake game**

Written in python / Possibly called python

**Object oriented programming**

## First milestone:
-	**Scope statement:**
    - Creatuing a game
    - Where we control fine line
    - Has adam’s head on it
    - Lose game if you hit self or boundary
    - Grows when it eats
    - Not doing high score table (unless time allows)
    - Body follows snake head’s path exactly
    - Possibly make adam’s head flop like a south park Canadians head when it eats (time allowing)
    - Keeps score
    - Cant go backwards
    - Only accepts: W, A, S, D, L-arrow, R-arrow, U-arrow, D-arrow
    - It eats (possibilities):
      - Homework
      - Tests
      - Apples
      - Lines of code


-	**Milestones:**
    - **1st:** 3/28, make snake that can move through infinite space
    - **2nd:** 3/31, if snake head hits border it ends game
    - **3rd:** 4/2, implement object for adam’s face to eat, keeps track of score
    - **4th:** 4/4, snake grows when it eats objects, body of snake follows head’s path exactly
    - **5th:** 4/9, the game ends if the snake hits itself
      
-	**Timeline:**
make a pretty picture of the milestones


-	**Executive summary:**
Write all of the exec summary.
