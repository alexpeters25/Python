Agile project
Snake game
Written in python
Possibly called python
Object oriented programming

First milestone:
-	Scope statement:
o	Creatuing a game
o	Where we control fine line
o	Has adam’s head on it
o	Lose game if you hit self or boundary
o	Grows when it eats
o	Not doing high score table (unless time allows)
o	Body follows snake head’s path exactly
o	Possibly make adam’s head flop like a south park Canadians head when it eats (time allowing)
o	Keeps score
o	Cant go backwards
o	Only accepts: W, A, S, D, L-arrow, R-arrow, U-arrow, D-arrow
o	It eats (possibilities):
	Homework
	Tests
	Apples
	Lines of code


-	Milestones:
o	1st: 3/28, make snake that can move through infinite space
o	2nd: 3/31, if snake head hits border it ends game
o	3rd: 4/2, implement object for adam’s face to eat, keeps track of score
o	4th: 4/4, snake grows when it eats objects, body of snake follows head’s path exactly
o	5th: 4/9, the game ends if the snake hits itself
-	Timeline: make a pretty picture of the milestones


-	Executive summary:
o	Write all of the exec summary.
