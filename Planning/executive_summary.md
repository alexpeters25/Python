### 2. Process to Solve the Problem
**i. Conceptualization:** Brainstorm possible game ideas and delegate roles and responsibilities among the team

**ii. Planning:** Create a plan that lays out how we will program the game and how it will function

**iii. Design:** Design a framework for the basic requirements and structures that will be needed for proper function in development

**iv. Programming:** Program the game, churning out iterations to be updated and built upon

**v. Closure:** Ensure that the game is properly functional and document and review the results

### 3. Proposed Solution

Create a UNK-themed snake game to provide students with an enjoyable outlet that strives to minimize campus boredom.
<br>
<br>
### 4. Expected Deliverables

**i.** A snake that travels in four directions, where travel into the snake's own body is a game-ending obstruction

**ii.** A playing field where the snake and fruit will exist, where travel into the border of the field is a game-ending obstruction

**iii.** A kind of fruit that appears on the field that if eaten, the snake grows. The location of each spawning of fruit will be randomized

**iv.** A score that tallies each fruit consumed

**v.** A UNK theme to the game that adds a unique flare to the visual style
