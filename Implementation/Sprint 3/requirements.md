# Milestone Three Requirements
## Functional Requirements
- Apple is collectable
- When the apple is collected it re-appears elsewhere
- When the apple is collected score goes up
- Score is displayed for the user

## Security Requirements
- All previously implemented features continue to work
- Apple spawns must be in collectable space
- Score increments as intended (one at a time) and does not cause any issues with the program
