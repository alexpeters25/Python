# Milestone One Testing Outcomes
1. Movement functions as intended
  - Testing: When there is no user input snake moves in the previously input direction,
      - Result: works as intended
  - Testing: New user input changes direction of snake
      - Result: works as intended
2. User input testing
  - Testing: When two keys are pressed the program uses a hierarchy to choose which button is used. The priority of up buttons is ordered up, down, right, left.
      -  Result: While this could be improved, it is functional and input does not cause any conflict within the program
